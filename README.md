A machine learning system that predicts customer churn probability and identifies key risk factors for business retention strategies.

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Logistic Regression model trained on customer data
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit web interface for real-time predictions
- **Risk Analysis**: Identifies top factors influencing churn probability
- **Actionable Insights**: Recommends retention strategies based on risk level

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
